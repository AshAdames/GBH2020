# Give Back Hacks 2020 Submission

A web app made with the MERN stack that allows users to sign up, create a drive and post it on the site for others to view. 

The purpose of the Drive is to create something like a food drive, school drive or other supply gathering drive. 
You can provide a name, location and a list of items for each drive, which will then be posted on the main page.
